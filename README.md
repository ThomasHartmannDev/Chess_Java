- The queen moves horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
- The king moves one square in any direction.

### Objective

## FAQ

### Why are some parts of the code commented in Portuguese?

The code is developed by Thomas Hartmann, and some comments may be in Portuguese to facilitate his understanding and programming speed. These comments will be translated into English as needed.

### Why are some parts of the code not commented?

Some sections of the code may not have comments for various reasons: redundancy, oversight, or complexity. If there are unexplained parts, it's because the author may not feel confident in explaining them.
