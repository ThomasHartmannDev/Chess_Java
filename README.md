## FAQ - important issues

### Why do some parts of this code have comments in Portuguese?
The code is made only by me (Thomas Hartmann), so to facilitate my understanding of the code with the aim of programming faster, comments will be made in Portuguese.
Therefore, all comments must and will be translated as soon as possible.

### Why do some parts of this code is not commented ? 
Maybe some parts of this code will be not commented. First, maybe is can be repetitive to explain the same thing all the time, second maybe I forgot to comment it, 
Three (rare) I don't know how to explain, I just know and understand how it works, but I'm NOT confident to explain it. What I mean is, if I can't explain something,
I'd rather say nothing than talk shit.
